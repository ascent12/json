A JSON library written in C11.

The current version of autoconf (2.69) doesn't support C11 properly,
so you must use the git version of autoconf to compile this library.
You MUST compile this with a compiler that supports C11, as several
C11 features are used.

To compile:
  autoreconf --install
  ./configure
  make
  make install

To use:
   cc ... -ljson11

Make sure /usr/local/lib is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH, as that is the
default install location.
